	/// <summary>
	/// Interface for components that can interrupt other processes or actions.
	/// This interface defines a contract for interruptible behavior,
	/// allowing implementing classes to signal when an interrupt is requested.
	/// For now it is used in AIExecutor to interrupt current action like getting hit or death.
	/// Defining here to avoid circular dependency between Component and UtilityAi namespaces.
	/// And also because this interface is very generic and can be used by other systems in the future.
	/// Not just AIExecutor.
