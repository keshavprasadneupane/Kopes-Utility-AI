	/// It encapsulates the UniqueID, CommonEntityHashedTag, and EntityComponentRegistry associated with an Entity.
	///  This class is used to store and pass around these critical pieces of information together, especially 
	/// when notifying systems about an Entity's death or pooling events through the OnEntityDiedOrPooled event 
	/// in the EntityManager. By using this class, we can ensure that all relevant details about an Entity are 
	/// easily accessible and organized when needed for various operations within the ECS framework.
